# Build a PWA with Next.JS

This is boilerplate, to get a NextJS app up and running with:
** PWA (lighthouse audit passes, downloadable)
** custom server, with express custom route
** alternative custom routes available with the /pages/api from nextjs
** socket.io implemented in the custom server for real-time bidirectional communication.
